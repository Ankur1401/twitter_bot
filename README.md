# twitter_bot
1. trying to make a *somewhat* interactive twitter bot using Python. Inspired from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0wWwglE1Vc&t=0s).
2. We will be using tweepy to access twitter APIs.
3. We will **NOT** be using any sort of machine learning or deep learning or NLP in this project.(not yet at least)
4. Please document your code well.
[UPDATE]
The bot is presently responding with some relevant facts.
[Soon Todo]
1. Add more facts to the database to make the replies more relevant facts.
2. Optimise the code, if need be.
3. Maybe should change the database from pickle to some other systems.
